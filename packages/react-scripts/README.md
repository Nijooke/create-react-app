# react-scripts

This package includes scripts and configuration used by Mindbaz's custom [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).<br>

The key differnce with Facebook CRA's original react-scripts is the use of [emotion](https://github.com/emotion-js/emotion)

Please refer to its documentation:
